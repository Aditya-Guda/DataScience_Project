Analyzing Crime in Chicago
• Correlating crime descriptions, demographics, and economic disparity levels from the Chicago Police Department with data from the Survey of Income, which has 200 lines of data where the data are discovered in data, to analyze Chicago crime statistics and correlate them with certain features or trends. 
• The City of Chicago, which I cleaned to get numerical data for exploratory data analysis. I then plotted the findings of these techniques, which are based on the kinds of crimes that are committed in Chicago. I performed linear regression, time series analysis, K-means clustering, and other analyses.
